      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5) Legal bases (UK GDPR / EU GDPR)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Depending on the context, we rely on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the Services you request, including PRO subscriptions and advertiser services.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – site security, fraud prevention, service improvement, non-personalised/contextual ads, basic analytics (where allowed), and business operations (balanced against your interests—contact us for our LIA summary).</li>
          <li><strong>Consent</strong> – cookies/SDKs for analytics and advertising; personalised ads; non-essential preferences; certain marketing communications. You can withdraw consent at any time via <strong>Manage Cookies</strong> or email preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> – tax, accounting, and regulatory compliance; responding to lawful requests.</li>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7) Profiling & automated decisions</h2>
        <p>
          We use analytics and ad tech to create non-sensitive audience segments (e.g., "tech shoppers") and to set frequency caps or recommend content. We do <strong>not</strong> make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects solely by automated means. Personalised ads/profiling are used only with consent in UK/EEA/CH.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">8) Sharing & disclosures</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We share personal data with:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Service providers / processors:</strong> cloud hosting, analytics, anti-fraud, content delivery, CRM/support, email delivery, payment processing (PCI-compliant), and consent management.</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Except as described, we do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data. In certain US jurisdictions, "share" for cross-context behavioural advertising may apply; see Regional Notices (§16).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">9) International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Your data may be processed outside the UK/EEA/CH. Where this occurs, we use <strong>appropriate safeguards</strong> (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses with UK Addendum, partner certifications, and technical/organisational measures). Details are available upon request.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">10) Cookies & similar technologies</h2>

        <p>
          We act as <strong>independent controller</strong> for data we collect through the Services. Where an advertiser provides us with personal data (e.g., conversion events through a server-to-server API), the parties will typically act as independent controllers, unless a separate Data Processing Agreement (DPA) states otherwise. We can provide our standard DPA on request where we act as a processor.
